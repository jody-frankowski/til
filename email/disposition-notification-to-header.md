# The Disposition-Notification-To Header

The Disposition-Notification-To header, first defined in
[RFC 3798](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3798), can be used to request the
recipient of an email to send back a Message Disposition Notification (MDN).
MDNs can be of two types, which are pretty self-explanatory:

- displayed
- deleted

Reply to an MDN request is of course optional as defined in the RFC.
