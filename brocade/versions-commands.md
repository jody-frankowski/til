# Brocades different versions commands

Apparently Brocade appliances support different commands.
The best way to search commands for your brocade product is to issue this command:

```
show version
[...]
System: NetIron CES [...]
[...]
```

This will output the product type and you'll be able to find the associated
commands on the [Brocade documentation site](http://www.brocade.com/content/html/en/command-reference-guide/netiron-05900-cliguide/index.html).
