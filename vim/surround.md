# Surround

With the [surround.vim plugin](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) you can
easily manage "surroundings" in your code. For example if I have the following
code:

```
(function arg1 arg2)
```

I can type `cs)"` to have the following result:

```
"function arg1 arg2"
```

Find more commands [in the official documentation](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround/blob/master/doc/surround.txt).

You can also do the same with the [evil-surround emacs package](https://github.com/timcharper/evil-surround).
