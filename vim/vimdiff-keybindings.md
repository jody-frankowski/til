# vimdiff keybindings

I already knew some of vimdiff keybindings like:

- `do` to 'obtain' the difference.
- `dp` to 'put' the difference.
- <c-w><c-w> to switch between diff windows (that's more of a vim binding).

But today I also learned about:

- `]c` to get to the next difference.
- `[c` to get to the previous difference.
