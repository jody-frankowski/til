# Mount Points

By default zfs automatically mounts all the zfs file systems it detects under
`/mount` where `mount` is the name of the file system.
It is still possible to manage those with `/etc/fstab` and the common `mount`
and `unmount` tools.

Find more information in zfs(8) man page, under "Mount Points".
