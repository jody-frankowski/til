# KVM Hypervisor Type

KVM can be considered both a Type-1 and Type-2 hypervisor. Because as it works
with a kernel module it runs directly on the hardware which qualifies it as a
Type-1 hypervisor. But as it is still running in Linux, which is a general
purpose OS, it can be categorized as a Type-2 hypervisor.
